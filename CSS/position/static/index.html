<h1>POSITION STATIC</h1>

<p>HTML elements are positioned static by default.

  Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
  
  An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:</p>

<div class="container" >
  <div class="static">This div element has position: static;</div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
