<h1>POSITION relative</h1>

<p>
  An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
</p>

<div class="container" >
  <div class="fixed">This div element has position: relative;</div>
</div>
